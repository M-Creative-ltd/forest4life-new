summary: >-
  Forest4Life operates a community tree nursery in Bugesera District, Rwanda,
  where we produce climate-adapted native indigenous trees and grafted fruit
  seedlings, including mango and Hass avocado varieties. The nursery was
  established to address farmers’ limited access to quality planting materials
  suited to dry conditions. By producing strong, resilient seedlings locally, we
  improve survival rates, support land restoration, and help farmers increase
  their income through agroforestry.
