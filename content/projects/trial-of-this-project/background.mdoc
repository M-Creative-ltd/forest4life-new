### The Challenge

Eastern part of Rwanda faces:

- Severe land degradation
- Low soil fertility
- Increasing drought vulnerability
- Limited access to quality fruit seedlings
- Low survival rates of non-adapted tree species

Farmers were hesitant to plant trees that did not generate direct income. At the same time, poor land management practices were reducing agricultural productivity.

### Our Response

Forest4Life established a community nursery to:

- Produce climate-adapted seedlings locally
- Improve survival rates
- Promote agroforestry systems that combine income and restoration
