## Why Environmental Clubs?

Rwanda faces increasing climate variability, soil degradation, and declining biodiversity. Long-term restoration requires behavioral change starting at a young age.

Primary schools are powerful platforms for:

- Building environmental awareness
- Developing climate leadership
- Promoting tree planting culture
- Encouraging sustainable land use practices

Many schools lack structured environmental programs and practical conservation activities.

## Our Approach

Forest4Life established school environmental clubs to:

- Integrate conservation education with hands-on action
- Support practical tree planting activities
- Promote climate-resilient agriculture awareness
- Inspire youth-led environmental stewardship

This approach aligns with global youth climate engagement movements promoted by organizations like GLF (Global Landscapes Forum), emphasizing youth as leaders in restoration.
