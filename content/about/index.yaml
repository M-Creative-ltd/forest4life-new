  paragraphs:
    - >-
      Founded in 2018, Forest4Life emerged from a pressing need to address
      Rwanda's environmental challenges while creating sustainable livelihoods
      for rural communities. Our founders, a team of environmental scientists
      and community development experts, recognized that successful forest
      restoration requires both scientific rigor and deep community engagement.

      What started as a small pilot project in Bugesera District has grown into
      a nationally recognized organization, implementing large-scale restoration
      projects across multiple districts. Our approach combines traditional
      ecological knowledge with modern conservation science, ensuring that our
      interventions are both environmentally sound and culturally appropriate.

      Today, we work closely with government agencies, international partners,
      and local communities to restore degraded landscapes, improve agricultural
      productivity, and build resilience against climate change impacts.
