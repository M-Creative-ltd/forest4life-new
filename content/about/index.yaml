  paragraphs:
    - >-
      Founded in 2023, Forest4Life emerged from a pressing need to address
      Rwanda's environmental challenges while creating sustainable livelihoods
      for rural communities. Our founders, a team of environmental scientists
      and community development experts, recognized that successful forest
      restoration requires both scientific rigor and deep community engagement.
    - >-
      What started as a small pilot project in Bugesera District has grown into
      a nationally registered and recognized organization, implementing
      large-scale restoration projects across three districts. Our approach
      combines traditional ecological knowledge with modern conservation
      science, ensuring that our interventions are both environmentally sound
      and culturally appropriate.

      Today, we work closely with government agencies, international partners,
      and local communities to restore degraded landscapes, improve agricultural
      productivity, and build resilience against climate change impacts.
