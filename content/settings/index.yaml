    Forest4Life is a youth-led organization in Rwanda that owns and operates a
    community tree nursery in Bugesera District. We produce climate-adapted
    native indigenous trees and grafted fruit seedlings, including mango and
    Hass avocado. We started this nursery because farmers lacked access to
    quality fruit seedlings, and many available tree species were not adapted to
    the dry conditions, resulting in low survival rates. Farmers were also
    reluctant to plant trees that did not generate direct income. At the same
    time, land degradation and poor land management were reducing productivity.
    We address these challenges by providing resilient seedlings and training
    farmers in agroforestry and conservation agriculture to restore soil health
    and increase income.
